# Consumer-Complaints-Database

Introduction and Background:

Consumers in the United States complain about a variety of products, services, companies etc. It is also difficult to understand what are the factors that really are responsible for the complaints. In order to obtain better insight on the characteristics pertaining to that of the consumer complaints, we try to analyse this dataset and try to answer some of the business questions (Accross All States) with visualisations like,

1. Top 10 companies by complaint
2. Top 10 complaints by product
3. Top 5 complaints by company response
4. Number of complaints with timely response
5. Number of complaints by day of week
6. Volume of complaints by state

User Story:

Whenever a complaint is submitted, consumers are heard by the companies, and they try to resolve them efficiently and also the companies or the products can learn from the complaint and make sure to resolve them permanently, also to avoid similar ones. Every complaint provides insight into problems that people are experiencing, helping the companies identify inappropriate practices and also enabling them to follow some of the best practices, and stopping them before they become major issues.

With the analysis of this dataset, the aim is better outcomes for consumers.
